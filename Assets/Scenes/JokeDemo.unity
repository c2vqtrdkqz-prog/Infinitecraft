# This is a placeholder scene file. To create the example scene open Unity, create a new 2D Scene named "JokeDemo", then:
# 1. Create a Canvas (GameObject -> UI -> Canvas).
# 2. Inside the Canvas create a Button (UI -> Button) and rename it "FetchButton".
# 3. Install TextMeshPro if prompted and create two Text - TextMeshPro objects named "SetupText" and "PunchlineText" and one small TextMeshPro object named "StatusText".
# 4. Create an empty GameObject named "JokeManager" and attach the script Assets/Scripts/JokeManagerTMP.cs (or the existing Assets/Scripts/JokeManager.cs).
# 5. Wire the Button to fetchButton and the TMP fields to their respective slots on the JokeManager component.
# 6. Save the scene as Assets/Scenes/JokeDemo.unity.
